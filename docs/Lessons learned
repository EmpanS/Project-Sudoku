Here I can discuss what my lessons learned


Learned a lot about documenting code


Machine learning:
  - Data processing
      - Got to gather data and label data
      - Got to build a data pipeline
      - Key insights
          - Importance of validating the data   (miss-classified images using my python script)
          - 
  - Convolutional Neural Networks
      - Got to improve my skills
      - Got to use Transfer learning
      - Used a validation set to mitigate overfitting
